## Work in progress

## Objective
Implement a few container types of the C++98 standard template library
  namely vector, stack, map and set.

## Some Requirements

  * Member functions, Non-member and overloads are expected.
 
  * std::allocator must be used and the inner data structure for each container must be coherent.
 
  * If the container has an iterator system, you must implement it.
 
  * Iterators_traits, reverse_iterator, enable_if, is_integral, 
      equal/lexicographical compare, std::pair, std::make_pair, must be reimplemented.
